# Vocabulary List Generator

## Description:
üìùThis program queries Google, WikiPedia and Oxford Dictionary for the definitions of multiple words and compiles these definitions into a single "vocabulary" list

## Usage:
Simply enter words separated by commas into the program and it will return the list of words and the top definition for each word.

Note: Part of the program is still quite unstable and may not always give the most relevant definition

## Dependencies:
The program uses the following libraries:
<a href="https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium">Selenium</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pwaller/pyfiglet">PyFiglet</a>
<br>
The libraries have been taken care of in the <a href="https://github.com/museHD/Vocab-List-Gen/releases">exe release</a>
<br><br>
However, all users will need to have the **matching/compatible** versions of Google Chrome and [Chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/)  installed.
Eg. If you have Chrome 86, download the ChromeDriver v86 from the above link.
